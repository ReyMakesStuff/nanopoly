## WTF?
These are various files for nanDECK (http://www.nandeck.com/), created by Andrea Nand (https://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/n_and). 

## What's Included
For now, not a damn thing. But I will be uploading my files after I make sure they don't look too embarrassing.

## What's Not Included
Kabel font. I cannot share this font since it is not a free font. For more information on this font, see https://www.dafontfree.co/kabel-font/
